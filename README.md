## Q&A

### Parts of the pads missing
Some parts of the pads (generally the ground support equipment) are parts and intended to be put on the vessel before launch.

### Centering the vessels:
Use Editor Extensions Redux and press [B] to center the vessel in the VAB so it's aligned with the pads.

### RSS-Textures:
Should be installed before otherwise it will replace the modified heightmap and result in visual artifacts.

There is a version made specifically for RP-1 (career mode) at https://github.com/KSP-RO/RSS-CanaveralHD
